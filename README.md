# cap-platform-backend
Backend files
This project uses Angular for frontend and NestJS for backend. I have made use of components to render respective components separately. Made use of routes to move different endpoints. API-GATEWAY is used to take request from frontend and enable microservices. Microservice will form exchanges and queues in rabbitmq and store respective details. Backend platform is made to handle request and response from frontend and API-GATEWAY. Postgres Database is used to store all the details.
